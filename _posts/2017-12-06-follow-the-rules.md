# Try your best to write the right code before runnig it!!!

### Requirements 
- Write the test cases: input -> output 
- Write the test code: can have an incomplete implementation, but should cover all cases

### Design
- Give the _skeleton_ first: files, classes and procedures

### Implementation 
- Write the code after you understand all the related code
- Write the code unless you konw what you are doing

### _The process can repeat: Requirements -> Design -> Requirements -> Design_

# Test you code
- Assume any code is buggy before you test it
- UnitTest
- End-to-End test: from the first input to the final result
- Test cases should _cover every line of code_
- Run tests at the _target environment_
- Never skip examining each piece of result: the log, the db and the resultant file 
- Never skip unexpected results even if the final result is right
